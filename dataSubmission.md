### Starting point 
Applications and research questions using motor unit identification methods are diverse and yield heterogeneous EMG datasets, for example, in terms of tasks, subject variability, the utilized electrodes, electrode configuration, and data acquisition systems. It is essential to reflect this diversity in the MUnitQuest's data collection. This is only feasible through a community-based effort. We would be happy if you consider contributing some of your data! To balance realism and label accuracy, we invite the submission of both experimental and simulated data. 

In short, depending on the type of data you want to contribute, a submission consists of the following parts:

### Raw Data and Metadata Submission
We will provide all EMG data entering the competition in the standardized [EMG-BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/electromyography.html) format. To make getting started with EMG-BIDS as easy as possible, we support two options for your data submission:

- Upload of EMG-BIDS-formatted data, which we facilitate by providing template files that you can adopt according to your specific recording setup
- Assisted generation of EMG-BIDS compatible metadata files through our [web form](/metadata-form/)

### Labeled Motor Unit Spike Trains
A key requirement for a competition on motor unit identification methods is the availability of labeled ground truth spikes. Thus, we additionally require submitting:

- for each recording, a *.tsv* file containing the labeled motor unit spike trains
- a short description (2-page PDF) of the utilized labelling approach (for experimental EMG data)
- or a short description (2-page PDF) of the simulation model (for synthetic EMG data)
